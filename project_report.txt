================================================================================
Date: February 17, 2026
Project: College Placement Cell Portal
Objective: Student Portal Expansion & Backend Robustness

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project focused on transforming the basic placement portal into an advanced 
management system. Key achievements include the implementation of automated 
academic tracking, a smart job eligibility engine, a one-click application 
process, and a multi-channel notification system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. ACADEMIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
   - Implemented Semester-wise GPA and Credit tracking.
   - Automated Overall CGPA calculation logic triggered on result updates.
   - Profile completeness tracking for students.

B. SMART JOB ELIGIBILITY ENGINE
   - Added eligibility criteria to Job postings (Min CGPA, Backlogs, Department).
   - Dynamic dashboard filtering: Students only see jobs they qualify for.

C. ONE-CLICK APPLICATION SYSTEM
   - Simplified job application process with a single click.
   - Real-time status tracking (Applied, Under Review, Shortlisted, etc.).
   - Prevention of duplicate applications.

D. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
   - Real-time notification banner on the Student Dashboard.
   - Dedicated Notifications Page with detailed alert history.
   - Categorized alerts (Success, Info, Warning).

E. ACCESS CONTROL
   - Restricted Placement Officer registration to a dedicated private route.
   - Role-based dashboard rendering (Student, Teacher, Officer).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BACKEND (Django & Django REST Framework)
- Models Updated/Added:
  * Student: Enhanced with CGPA, skills, and resume fields.
  * SemesterResult: Tracks performance per semester.
  * Job: Includes detailed eligibility criteria.
  * JobApplication: Manages the link between students and jobs.
  * Notification: Stores personalized alerts for users.
- Logic:
  * Signal-like behavior in `SemesterResult.save()` to update student CGPA.
  * Custom filtering logic in `StudentDashboardView`.

FRONTEND (React & Vite)
- Components Built/Modified:
  * Student.jsx: Redesigned for dynamic data and application flow.
  * Notifications.jsx: New page for alert management.
  * Navbar.jsx: Linked notifications and updated styles.
  * Home.jsx: Improved session handling and loading states.
- Technologies: Framer Motion (Animations), Lucide React (Icons), Axios (API).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. DATABASE SCHEMA (MODELS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- User (Custom Model): Roles - student, teacher, placement.
- Student: dob, gender, department, cgpa, backlogs, profile_completion.
- SemesterResult: student_id, semester, gpa, credits, backlogs.
- Job: company, role, salary, min_cgpa, allowed_departments, deadline.
- JobApplication: student_id, job_id, status, applied_on.
- Notification: user_id, title, message, is_read, created_at.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. VERIFICATION & TESTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Seed Data: A comprehensive seed script (`seed_data.py`) was created to 
  populate the system with valid test cases.
- Logic Validation: Manual and script-based verification of CGPA math 
  (e.g., 8.5 + 7.8 GPA weighted by credits correctly yields 8.13 CGPA).
- Flow Testing: Verified registration -> login -> dashboard viewing -> 
  applying for eligible jobs -> receiving notifications.
